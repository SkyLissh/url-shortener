# ðŸ”— URL Shortener | React + FastAPI

A simple project to shorten URLs using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for Frontend and [FastAPI](https://tiangolo.fastapi.com/) for Backend.

## ðŸŽˆ Overview

The main idea is learn how to test both React and FastAPI, applications.

For that purpose, I created a simple React app that uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to handle routing.
